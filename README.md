# Rosalind

My solutions to [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/) problems
written in C.

Each problem has its own subfolder, named with number and name of the problem as
on the website, containing:
- Source code
- Dataset file
- [Makefile]
- [Readme file]

Any help, optimization, suggestion or comment is apreciated!
